What if God is a programmer?
This program asks the question, What if God is a programmer and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis" target="_blank">simulation theory</a> is correct? This program will find and replace the words "word" and "God" with "code" and "the programmer" there are some other key words that are replaced as well to make the end result more concise with simulation theory P.s. If you enter your own text remember to enter some punctuation to make it work nicely.
